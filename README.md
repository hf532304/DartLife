# DartLife

Final Project for CS165.

Description: Unlike some big cities, Hanover does not provide us much entertainment. Most of students have no idea what to do in their
leisure time. So we would like to design an application that can provide students some options about what to do, where to eat and what 
to read.Our app will have several parts, for example, in activity page people can share information of all kinds of activities including
place, date etc. In movie page, people can search the movie that they are interested in. Also, they can write review and rate the movie.

Since the app is designed for Dartmouth students, users need to take the photo of Dartmouth ID card before registration. The app
would fill the name, UID, DOB and Class automatically by the picture.

After registration, the user could go through the information of movie, entertainment and food around Dartmouth.
